This is WRPN v6.0, original release date 5 Feb 12.

WRPN is a public domain calculator for Microsoft Windows that is modeled after the Hewlett-Packard HP-16c.  This is not a Hewlett-Packard product.

WRPN uses Reverse Polish Notation, which uses the ENTER key instead of the "=" (equals) key.

In addition to all the functions you'd expect from an ordinary calculator, WRPN also has many features specifically designed for the computer professional:

    Floating point, Decimal, Hexadecimal, Octal and Binary modes
    Word sizes from 1-64 bits per word
    Signed math (1's complement, 2's complement, unsigned)
    Logical operators (and, or, xor, not, masks, etc)
    Bit-wise operators (shift, rotate, rotate with carry, etc)
    32 storage registers
    4 position stack
    203 lines of program memory

WRPN was written in Visual Basic .Net and full source code is available at http://www.wrpn.emmet-gray.com
